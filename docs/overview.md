# Overview

Contract-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a **runtime engine that reads an OpenAPI contract and turns it into a fully functional CRUD API**.
Instead of generating code from the contract ("contract-first") or documenting code after the fact ("code-first"), the
contract itself becomes the product: a single source of truth that the platform executes.

You provide a well designed openapi contract. The CaaS runtime reads that contract and provides a functional API. 
Your development team spends less time implementing endpoints and more time designing clear, consistent contracts and 
focusing on business logic.
